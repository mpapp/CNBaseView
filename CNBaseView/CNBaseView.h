/** @name Handling Subviews */

/**
 Pushs in another view as subview using the defined animation effect.
 
 There are several animation effects available:
 
    typedef enum {
        CNChildViewAnimationEffectNone = 0,
        CNChildViewAnimationEffectFade,
        CNChildViewAnimationEffectSlideTop,
        CNChildViewAnimationEffectSlideRight,
        CNChildViewAnimationEffectSlideBottom,
        CNChildViewAnimationEffectSlideLeft
    } CNChildViewAnimationEffect;
 
 `CNChildViewAnimationEffectNone`<br />
 The child view will be shown immediatly without an animation effect. It abolishes the setting of preventDrawingWithSubviews, the icon and text are not drawn.

 `CNChildViewAnimationEffectFade`<br />
 The child view will fade in.

 `CNChildViewAnimationEffectSlideTop`<br />
 The child view will silde in from the top edge downwards.

 `CNChildViewAnimationEffectSlideRight`<br />
 The child view will silde in from the right edge to the left.

 `CNChildViewAnimationEffectSlideBottom`<br />
 The child view will silde in from the bottom edge upwards.

 `CNChildViewAnimationEffectSlideLeft`<br />
 The child view will silde in from left edge to the right.

 After the animation is done the completionHandler is executed.

 @note If you decide to use one of these effects and the value of preventDrawingWithSubviews is set to `NO` then you have to ensure that
 your pushing child view has an opaque background. Otherwise the drawn icon and text message will show through.
